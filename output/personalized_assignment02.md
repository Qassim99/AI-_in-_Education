### Assignment Title: Personalized Project - Transformer Models for Text Classification

Hi Qasim Sefaldeen,

Deadline: 2025-09-13

### 1. Project Overview
It's great to see your objective, practical, and independent approach to deep learning. This project is perfectly tailored to leverage these strengths by diving into the application of Transformer Models for a core text mining task. Your focused and hands-on style will be invaluable as you implement and analyze a state-of-the-art architecture. This assignment will not only solidify your understanding of Transformer mechanisms but also provide a practical application, allowing you to demonstrate your ability in *applying methods* and *showing reasoning and reflection* through empirical results and critical analysis.

### 2. Your Tailored Assignment Path: Independent Project
Given your preference for an objective, practical, and independent learning style, your assignment will take the form of an **Independent Project**. You will be tasked with implementing and evaluating a Transformer-based model for text classification, a direct application of our recent lecture on Transformer Models in Deep Learning. This path will enable you to explore the architecture in depth, make informed design choices, and critically assess its performance on a real-world problem.

### 3. Your Challenges
*   **ðŸŽ¯ Core Challenge: Transformer for Text Classification**
    Implement a simplified Transformer encoder (or a small pre-trained Transformer like a distilled version) for a text classification task. You can choose a dataset similar to the ones discussed in the context of text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification).
    Your implementation should include:
    *   **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare text data, including tokenization and numericalization.
    *   **Input Embeddings:** Utilize word embeddings (e.g., pre-trained Word2Vec or GloVe) and integrate positional encodings as input to the Transformer.
    *   **Transformer Encoder:** Implement a basic Transformer encoder block, incorporating Multi-Head Attention, Feed-Forward Networks, Layer Normalization, and Residual Connections.
    *   **Classification Head:** Add a suitable classification layer on top of the Transformer's output to predict the target class.
    *   **Training and Evaluation:** Train your model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) on a held-out test set. Analyze the performance, identifying strengths and potential areas for improvement.

*   **ðŸš€ Stretch Challenge: Comparative Analysis & Interpretability**
    Extend your project by comparing your Transformer model with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the same text classification task, drawing inspiration from the CNN architectures for text discussed in `lecture_4.pdf`.
    *   **CNN Implementation/Adaptation:** Briefly implement or adapt a CNN-based text classifier as described in the provided lecture material (e.g., using varying filter sizes and max-over-time pooling).
    *   **Performance Comparison:** Conduct a thorough comparison of your Transformer and CNN models, analyzing their performance metrics, training time, and parameter efficiency.
    *   **Attention Mechanism Analysis:** Investigate the attention weights within your Transformer model. Visualize or analyze what parts of the input sequence the model focuses on for specific predictions, and reflect on how this provides insight into the model's reasoning. Discuss how this interpretability differs from the CNN's feature extraction. This will push your *applying methods* and *reasoning and reflection* skills.

### 4. Recommended Resources & Next Steps
To successfully complete your project, focus on the following:

*   **Transformer Architecture:** Review the fundamental components of the Transformer: Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encodings, Feed-Forward Networks, and the Encoder-Decoder structure (though you'll primarily focus on the Encoder for classification). A strong conceptual grasp is key for implementation.
*   **`lecture_4.pdf` (CNNs for Text Mining):**
    *   **Slides 43-44 ("Input representation" and "Convolution operation"):** Understand how text is typically represented as input (word embeddings) and how a sliding window (conceptually similar to convolution) can extract features. This will be crucial for your Transformer's input layer and for understanding the CNN baseline in your stretch challenge.
    *   **Slides 45-47 ("Network architecture" and "Max-over-time pooling"):** Pay attention to the overall structure and pooling mechanism of CNNs for text classification, which will be essential for comparing with your Transformer in the stretch challenge.
    *   **Slides 48-49 ("Embeddings" and "Multi-channel word embeddings"):** Consider how different embedding strategies affect model performance, a concept relevant to both CNNs and Transformers.
*   **`assignment_muster.pdf`:** Use this document as a template for structuring your conceptual discussions and reporting your applied exercises. Pay attention to the level of detail expected in explanations and comparisons.

### 5. Deliverables & Submission
Please submit the following by **2025-09-13**:

1.  **Code Repository (GitHub Link):** A link to a well-organized GitHub repository containing all your code (Python scripts/Jupyter Notebooks). Ensure your code is thoroughly commented, executable, and clearly demonstrates both the Core and (if attempted) Stretch Challenges.
2.  **Project Report (PDF):** A concise report (approx. 5-8 pages for Core, 8-12 pages for Stretch) in PDF format, covering:
    *   **Introduction:** Briefly state the problem, chosen dataset, and your project goals.
    *   **Methodology:** Detail your Transformer model's architecture, key design choices (e.g., embedding type, number of heads/layers, hidden dimensions), and justification for these choices. If attempting the Stretch Challenge, describe your CNN implementation/adaptation as well.
    *   **Experimental Setup:** Describe your dataset, preprocessing steps, training procedure, and evaluation metrics.
    *   **Results & Analysis:** Present your model's performance. For the Core Challenge, discuss the Transformer's effectiveness and any observed patterns. For the Stretch Challenge, provide a comparative analysis between the Transformer and CNN (performance, computational cost, parameter count).
    *   **Discussion & Reflection:** Critically reflect on your findings. Explain *why* your models performed as they did. For the Stretch Challenge, discuss the insights gained from analyzing attention weights, and compare the interpretability and limitations of both architectures for text classification.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize your key learnings and potential future work.
3.  **`requirements.txt`:** A file listing all necessary Python packages and their versions to reproduce your environment.

Good luck, Qasim! I'm looking forward to seeing your practical application of Transformer Models and your insightful reflections.
